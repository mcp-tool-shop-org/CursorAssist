## What MouseTrainer Is

MouseTrainer is a deterministic training tool that isolates and drills the real-world mouse tasks developers and designers perform daily — dragging, dropping, precise targeting, and multi-step cursor workflows — so users build speed and confidence in their actual work environment.

## What MouseTrainer Is Not

- **Not an aim trainer.** No crosshairs, no flick shots, no FPS mechanics.
- **Not an arcade game.** No lives, no high-score chasing, no abstract challenges designed for entertainment.
- **Not an abstract cursor puzzle.** Every task must map directly to a real mouse action users already perform in desktop software.

## Who It Is For

- **Developers** who spend hours in IDEs, terminals, and browser devtools — dragging tabs, selecting text ranges, resizing panels, navigating complex UIs.
- **Designers and office power users** who work in tools like Figma, Excel, or file managers — drag-and-drop, precise placement, multi-select workflows.

## Committed Mode

**Drag-and-Drop Gauntlet**

Trains precise drag-and-drop under pressure.

## Deferred / Explicitly Not Building Yet

These are not rejected — they are deferred until the first mode ships and proves the platform.

- Reflex Gates (existing sandbox/probe — quarantined, not deleted)

- Multi-select / lasso training
- Tab/panel drag reordering
- Scroll-and-click precision
- Resize handle training
- Any meta-system (progression, unlocks, daily challenges)
- Any social features (leaderboards, sharing)
- Any analytics dashboard or stats beyond per-session results
